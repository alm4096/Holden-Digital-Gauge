# PCB

Use your favorite PCB manufacturer to upload **CanBus.zip** and create your PCB. I use JLCPCB (select Global shipping for ultra cheap shipping) but you can use whoever you like.

## Files

**CanBus.zip** has been provided for your convenience. It contains everything you need to have the PCB manufactured.
**CarCan** folder has the KiCad project and all the necessary files for you to modify it however you please.
